# summrise.io
A book summary web app intended to help users retain the information gained from reading books by rewriting their own summaries of each of the book's chapters.

**Running the app**

The app runs using node.js - `node app.js`

**Tools Used**

Apart from HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js, mongoDB and dependencies in `package.json`, tools used in this project are:
- `CK Editor 5 - https://docs.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/latest/index.html`
- `Semantic-UI - https://semantic-ui.com/`

**Basic Features**

The app's overarching purpose is to allow normal users to write their own summaries (i.e. in their own words) of the books that is either in Summrise.io's database or a book that they've requested.

When a book is requested, it is reviewed by admin users before it is added to the database.

Any user can edit their own chapter summaries, but they can't edit other users' chapter summaries.

Only admin users can add, edit or delete books to the database.
